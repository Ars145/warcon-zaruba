// The Kill distance rule's pure part: which kills it counts (one of the chosen weapons, from at
// least a distance), how many of them in one match catch a player, and what it keeps per player. A
// defibrillator or a fist reaches a few metres; the same kill from across the map is a player the
// game did not stop. Kills are counted per match, as the Team kill limit counts them, rather than
// within minutes: the feed gives no kill a time the panel can trust across batches (a batch the
// game sends again arrives late, with only the match clock), and a match is what the game itself
// numbers. No database, no game server; the live path (feed-events.ts) and the dry run
// (triggers.ts) run the same step.
